🔮 Core Magical Components

1. 🧠 The Grand Ritual (app.py and main.py)

Orchestrates the entire magical performance, like a conductor leading an AI symphony.

app.py acts as the incantation point, calling upon the powers of main.py.

main.py sets the stage, summons other modules, and manages the flow of the conversational adventure.

2. 💬 Keeper of Conversations (chat_manager.py)

Guardians of the Chat Realm, ensuring that every conversation is meticulously recorded and easily recalled.

Saves and loads entire conversations, allowing you to revisit past encounters with OTTO.

3. 📜 Chronicler of Exchanges (chat_history.py)

Diligently chronicles individual exchanges, preserving the ebb and flow of each interaction.

Manages the chat history, ensuring OTTO can access the context of your conversations.

4. 🗨️ The AI Conjurer (llm_interaction.py)

The bridge between the mortal realm and the domain of artificial intelligence.

Communes with the AI spirit (Ollama language model), channels its responses, and even conjures up a thinking animation while the AI ponders your queries.

5. 🔮 The Model Summoner (model_utils.py)

A master of summoning AI entities from the Ollama realm, each with unique strengths and capabilities.

Lists the available AI models and assists you in selecting the ideal companion for your quest.

6. 🖥️ Master of the Visual Arts (console_utils.py)

A true artisan of the console, responsible for the visual splendor of your AI adventure.

Crafts the colorful interface, banners, prompts, and displays, making your interaction with OTTO visually engaging.

7. 🧩 Guardian of Context (assemble.py)

A master of weaving together the threads of past interactions and external knowledge.

Provides OTTO with a richer context, enhancing its understanding and enabling more insightful responses.

8. 🔍 Seeker of Web Knowledge (ddg_search.py)

Empowers OTTO to venture into the vast digital library of the web.

Retrieves information using the DuckDuckGo search engine, enriching OTTO's knowledge base.

9. 🧠 The Memory Weaver (create_memories.py and ollama_embeddings.py)

These modules work together to capture and preserve the essence of OTTO's interactions.

create_memories.py stores the raw ingredients of each interaction—your prompts, OTTO's responses, and any relevant web search results.

ollama_embeddings.py: Transforms those memories into a language understood by AI, using embeddings to create a searchable and retrievable knowledge base.

🎨 Customization Canvases 🎨

Unleash your creativity and enhance OTTO with these customization opportunities:

🌈 Aesthetic Alchemy (console_utils.py)

Modify colors, banners, and text styles to personalize OTTO's visual presence.

Add new visual effects or animations to enhance the interactive experience.

🧠 Intellect Amplification (llm_interaction.py)

Fine-tune the system message to shape OTTO's personality and conversational style.

Experiment with different prompt templates to tailor OTTO's responses for specific tasks or domains.

🔍 Knowledge Expansion (assemble.py, ddg_search.py)

Integrate additional search engines or knowledge bases to expand OTTO's access to information.

Implement more sophisticated context assembly techniques to deepen OTTO's understanding.

💾 Memory Manipulation (chat_manager.py, chat_history.py)

Explore alternative storage methods for chat history, such as database integration, for greater persistence and scalability.

Implement features like chat merging or selective memory deletion to curate OTTO's knowledge base.

🔮 Model Mastery (model_utils.py)

Add support for different AI model providers, giving users a wider choice of AI companions.
