## 🧪 tests/ (The Proving Grounds)

Within this hallowed hall, the resilience of OTTO's magic is tested. Each module faces rigorous trials to ensure the stability and reliability of its enchantments. Cast `pytest` to witness these trials unfold.

## 🧵 Fabric Patterns

Fabric patterns are the mystic tapestries that guide OTTO's conversational flow. They are stored as Markdown files in the `~/.config/fabric/patterns/` directory.

### Pattern Structure

Each pattern consists of two main components:

1. **System Message**: Contained in `system.md`, this sets the overall behavior and context for OTTO.
2. **User Message Template**: (Optional) Contained in `user.md`, this provides a structure for user inputs.

### Creating Custom Patterns

To weave your own Fabric pattern:

1. Create a new directory in `~/.config/fabric/patterns/` with your pattern name.
2. Within this directory, create `system.md` with your desired system instructions.
3. Optionally, create `user.md` if you want to provide a template for user inputs.
4. Use the PatternManager to add your new pattern to the selected list.

Remember, the power of Fabric lies in its flexibility. Craft your patterns wisely to guide OTTO's responses in the direction of your choosing.

May this grimoire serve you well on your AI adventures! Happy coding, and may OTTO's wisdom, now woven with Fabric, always guide you! ✨
