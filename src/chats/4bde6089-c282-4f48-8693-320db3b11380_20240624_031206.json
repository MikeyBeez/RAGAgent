      "agent": "I'm Happy to Help!\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach (31 March 1685 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 28 July 1750) was a German composer and organist of the Baroque period. He is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in Western classical music. Bach excelled in many genres, including orchestral suites, motets, masses, passions, oratorios, cantatas, and organ music.\n\nBach's compositions are characterized by their technical mastery, innovative use of counterpoint, and profound emotional depth. He was a master of the fugue, a complex musical form that involves interweaving multiple melodic lines. His most famous works include his cantatas, such as \"Jesu, meine Freude,\" and his passions, like the \"St. Matthew Passion.\"\n\nThroughout his life, Bach worked as an organist and composer for various courts in Germany, including the court of Frederick the Great in Prussia. Despite facing many challenges, including poverty and personal tragedy, Bach continued to compose music until his death at age 65. His legacy has had a profound impact on classical music, and he is considered one of the greatest composers of all time.",
