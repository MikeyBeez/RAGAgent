Prompt:
why is the sky blue

Response:
The sky appears blue due to Rayleigh scattering. Rayleigh scattering is the scattering of light waves by particles of a similar size or wavelength. 

- **Sunlight** is composed of all the colors of the spectrum, including blue, violet, and yellow.
- **Blue light** has a shorter wavelength than other colors, meaning it can travel further through the atmosphere.
- **Blue light** is scattered more strongly than other colors because it has a shorter wavelength and is more likely to interact with particles in the atmosphere.
- **The blue light** we see from the ground is scattered upwards, away from our eyes. This is why the sky appears blue.

Rayleigh scattering is a natural phenomenon that occurs in all directions from the Sun. The blue color of the sky is a beautiful reminder of this scattering process.
