Prompt:
How can I make chicken soup

Response:
**Ingredients:**

* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 tablespoon onion, diced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 (15-ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chilies, undrained
* 6 cups chicken broth
* 1 tablespoon dried oregano
* 1 teaspoon dried thyme
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns, optional

**Instructions:**

1. Heat the olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat.
2. Add the onion and garlic and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
3. Add the tomatoes, chicken broth, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper.
4. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low.
5. Simmer for 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.
6. Season with black peppercorns, if desired.
7. Serve hot, with a side of crusty bread or a slice of crusty flatbread.

**Tips:**

* For a richer soup, use a combination of different cut vegetables, such as carrots, celery, or potatoes.
* To make a vegetarian soup, omit the chicken broth and add 1 (15-ounce) can of diced tomatoes with green chilies, undrained.
* Serve with a dollop of sour cream, Greek yogurt, or a drizzle of olive oil.
* Chicken soup can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

**Variations:**

* **Spicy Chicken Soup:** Add 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes to the soup mixture.
* **Chicken Noodle Soup:** Add 1/2 cup of cooked noodles to the soup mixture before adding the other ingredients.
* **Chicken and Dumpling Soup:** Add 1/2 cup of shredded chicken, 1/2 cup of chopped and cooked dumplings, and 1 tablespoon of butter to the soup mixture.
