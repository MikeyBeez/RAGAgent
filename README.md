# RAGAgent

REPL that uses RAG as it's context assembly

This code is a work in progress, not a polished gem.  I keep restarting this project as I learn more and more.  I want to build a chatbot that remembers everything.  So far I have a loop for chatting and a memories directory full of old prompts.  This is going to be one of my knowledgebases.  The test_chroma.py file seems to be a proof of concept for embeddings that I will implement next.  

I've discovered that chromadb doesn't reall do persistance.  So I will need to embed conversations everytime.
